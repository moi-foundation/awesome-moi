# Awesome MOI

> **The curated resource hub for building the next generation of decentralized applications on the MOI L1 blockchain.**

This repository is your essential guide for transitioning from legacy, app-centric networks to MOI's powerful **Participant-Centric** model.

## 🎯 Start Here: MOI Sprint

**[MOI Sprint](./resources/moi-sprint/)** is your hands-on learning path for building on MOI.

A structured, mission-based tutorial series that takes you from zero to deploying real applications. Each chapter builds on the previous, giving you practical experience with MOI's unique architecture.

| Chapter | Topic | What You'll Build |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| [Chapter 1](./resources/moi-sprint/Chapter%201%20-%20Native%20Assets.md) | Native Assets | Token swap app using MAS0 assets |
| Chapter 2 | *Coming Soon* | Soulbound tokens with Coco |
| Chapter 3 | *Coming Soon* | Full-stack DiApp |

**No smart contracts needed for basic assets.** MOI's native asset system lets you create, transfer, mint, and burn tokens at the protocol level.

### [Essentials](./essentials/)
Source of truth: Documentation, Vision Paper, Whitepaper, and community links (Discord, X, Telegram).

### [JS-MOI-SDK](./js-sdk/)
The JavaScript/TypeScript library for interacting with MOI. Create interactions, manage accounts, deploy logic, and work with native assets.

### [Coco Language](./coco-language/)
MOI's smart contract language for custom on-chain logic. Use when you need behavior beyond native assets—swaps, vaults, permissions, soulbound tokens.

## 🌟 Why MOI?

Traditional blockchains force all applications into a **single global state**—everyone waits in line for everyone else. This causes congestion, high fees, and scaling limits.

MOI introduces the **Interaction State Machine (ISM)**:
- **Parallel Execution** - Unrelated transactions don't block each other
- **Native Assets** - Protocol-level tokens without smart contracts
- **Participant-Centric** - Each user has their own chain state
- **Horizontal Scaling** - More nodes = faster network
