# MOI Sprint

**MOI Sprint** is the starting point for developers to learn how to use our tech stack to build on a contextual compute network.

Inspired by [Speedrun Ethereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/), MOI Sprint is a structured, mission-based learning path designed to take you from zero to building real applications on MOI. No fluff, no theory overload — just hands-on projects that teach you by doing.

## Why MOI Sprint?

- **Learn by building** — Every chapter is a real project you can deploy
- **Progressive difficulty** — Start simple, level up as you go
- **Scaffolding** — Learn the participant-centric way from day one
- **Production-ready code** — Not toy examples, actual patterns you'll use
